# Task A – Debugging a Task Management Module

**Please read the README first before beginning this task.**

---

## Overview

Task A is built around a small Python system that works like a simple task
manager. Imagine a list of tasks where you want to:

- filter tasks by who they belong to or how important they are,
- search for tasks by words in their titles,
- and get quick statistics about what’s going on in the list.

Right now, this little task manager isn’t behaving correctly. Some filters don’t
return the right tasks, some searches miss results, and the statistics it
produces aren’t always accurate.

Your job is to fix these issues so the system works the way a basic task manager
should — and so the tests for Task A pass successfully.

## What You Need To Do

1. Open the `task_a` folder in VS Code.
2. Open a terminal at the location of the `task_a` folder.
3. Run the tests using:

   ```sh
   pytest
   ```

4. Look at which tests fail and what behavior they expect.
5. Use only the Copilot mode assigned to you to fix the code in this folder.
6. Re-run `pytest` to check your progress as you make changes.
7. The researcher will track the 20-minute time limit and notify you when the
   time is over.
8. Read the tests to understand the expected behavior.
9. Use only your assigned Copilot mode to fix the code.
10. Re-run the tests until they pass or the time limit ends.

## Notes

- Manual editing is allowed.
- You may read any file inside `task_a`.
- The project is small, but the logic requires attention to detail.
- Stop after 20 minutes, even if the task is not finished.
- The task will follow up with a questionnaire as soon as the time is over.
