# Copilot Vibe Agentic Coding Study

This repository contains coding tasks for a study comparing two modes of GitHub Copilot: Vibe Coding (Ask Mode) and Agentic Coding (Agent Mode).

## Participant Groups

- **Group 1 (GAIA-inspired Tasks):** Data analysis and script creation tasks (e.g., CSV processing).
  - Assigned tasks: `task_group_1/task_1a/` and `task_group_1/task_1b/`.
- **Group 2 (SWE-inspired Tasks):** Feature implementation in Matplotlib.
  - Assigned tasks: `task_group_2/task_2a/` and `task_group_2/task_2b/`.

You will be assigned to one group based on the study design.

## Repository Contents

- `task_group_1/`: Tasks for Group 1.
  - `task_1a/`: Invasive species data analysis.
  - `task_1b/`: Mollusk bead age analysis.
- `task_group_2/`: Tasks for Group 2.
  - `task_2a/`: Smooth transitions between plots in Matplotlib.
  - `task_2b/`: Dark mode toggle for Matplotlib.
- Each task folder has its own README with instructions, code, tests, and data.

## Experiment Process (Step-by-Step)

The study takes 60 minutes total. Follow these steps in order:

1. **Phase 1: Onboarding & Consent (15 minutes)**
   - Arrive and review the study procedure.
   - Sign consent form.
   - Complete a background survey (experience with AI tools, programming).

2. **Phase 2: Task 1 Coding Session (15 minutes)**
   - The researcher assigns you a Copilot mode (Vibe or Agentic) for this task.
   - Navigate to your assigned task folder (based on your group).
   - Read the task README and implement the code using the assigned mode.
   - Screen recording and time tracking will occur.

3. **Phase 3: Post-Task Survey 1 (5 minutes)**
   - Complete a short survey rating the mode you just used.
   - Sample questions (Likert scale: 1-5, Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree):
     - "I trusted the AI suggestions."
     - "The mode aligned with my workflow."
     - "I felt in control of the coding process."
   - Write a brief reflection (e.g., "What was frustrating?").

4. **Phase 4: Task 2 Coding Session (15 minutes)**
   - Switch to the other Copilot mode.
   - Work on the second task in your group.
   - Screen recording continues.

5. **Phase 5: Post-Task Survey 2 (5 minutes)**
   - Rate the second mode with similar Likert questions.
   - Write a brief reflection.

6. **Phase 6: Comparative Interview (15 minutes)**
   - Discuss your experiences with both modes.
   - Answer comparative questions (e.g., "Which mode was more efficient?").

**Important:** Stick to the time limits. Do not switch modes mid-task. The researcher will guide you through each phase.
